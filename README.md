##The Productivity Tracker Chrome Extension is designed to monitor and analyze the time users spend on different websites. Once installed, the extension runs in the background, recording active tab usage and categorizing visited sites. It then provides a dashboard with analytics such as daily/weekly time breakdowns, most-visited sites, and productivity scores.
